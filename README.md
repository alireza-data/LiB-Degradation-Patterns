# Li-ion Battery Health Prediction using Gaussian Process Model

## Overview

This repository introduces a Gaussian process machine learning model for precise predictions of Li-ion battery health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL). The model is inspired by the research paper ["Identifying degradation patterns of lithium-ion batteries from impedance spectroscopy using machine learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15235-7) published in Nature.

## Data Source

The essential dataset for this model is available on Zenodo at [https://zenodo.org/records/3633835](https://zenodo.org/records/3633835). The shared dataset, initially utilized in the referenced research paper employing MATLAB, has been adapted for Python implementation. Key libraries such as Matplotlib and Numpy have been employed for efficient processing.
