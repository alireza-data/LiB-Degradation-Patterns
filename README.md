# LiB-Degradation-Patterns
Unveiling a Gaussian process machine learning model to predict Li-ion battery health (SOH) and remaining life (RUL). Leveraging impedance spectroscopy data and inspired by the Nature paper "Identifying degradation patterns of lithium-ion batteries". Implemented in Python using Matplotlib and Numpy.
